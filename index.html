	An optimate senator was performing an oration in the forum.<br>

	“Before I begin you must each of you, fall to your knees and praise Cato the Younger the most virtuous stoic and greatest of the roman patricians”<br>

	At that instant an elderly soldier, who by his own merit and valor in the spanish and gallic campaigns had risen to the rank of Primus Pilus of X Legio and had never once questioned the judgment of his Imperator, Gaius Julius Caesar completely understanding the necessity of barbarian pacification, pushed his way through the crowd to speak<br>

	“Tell me, who is the greatest of the Romans?” <br>

	“Cato you senile pleb” <br>

	“Wrong its Gaius Julius Caesar the direct descendant of Venus and Aeneas. If it was Cato as you say...wouldn't he have held consular imperium?” <br>

	The senator was visibly taken aback, immediately dropping his letter from Cicero He ran away crying those optimate crocodile tears. The same tears Cato wept when Caesar read aloud the erotic love letter Servilia had written him. The entire crowd applauded and immediately surrounded the soldier as he read aloud the latest edition to the gallic commentaries. A dove called “Victrix” perched itself atop the temple of Janus as Caesars eternal allies Publius Licinius Crassus and Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus were elected to the consulship. The optimate senator was later found and had manure dumped upon him while his wife and slaves watched.<br>
